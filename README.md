<h1>Handwritten Digit Recognition Web App</h1>h1>

* This is a web application that recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a deep learning model. The app is built with Flask and deployed on Render. Users can upload an image of a digit, and the app predicts the digit displayed in the image.


Features
* Digit Prediction: Upload a handwritten digit image, and the app predicts the digit.
* Interactive Web Interface: A simple and user-friendly front-end for uploading images and viewing predictions.
* Deep Learning Model: Uses a pre-trained deep neural network (mnist_ann_model.h5) trained on the MNIST dataset.
* Deployed on Render: Accessible online for testing and demonstration.

How It Works
* Upload an Image: Choose a file containing a handwritten digit (e.g., 5.png).
* Prediction: The app processes the image and predicts the digit using the loaded ML model.
* Output: Displays the prediction directly on the interface.


Deployment
* The app is deployed on Render. Visit the live demo:
